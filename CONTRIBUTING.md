## Contributing a New Port

to see if a port for your target app has already been requested.

2. Generate your new port: Use the [template](https://github.com/vague-theme/template).

3. Open an issue for your new port: After creating the port, open an issue in the [main repository](https://github.com/vague-theme/vague)
using [issue template](https://github.com/vague-theme/vague/issues/new?template=add-theme.yml).
